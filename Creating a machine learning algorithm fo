Creating a machine learning algorithm for predicting NBA games
Needs:
Stats: All kinds of advanced stats for each game team stats 
How do we assign the labels?
Plug in the two teams advanced stats and have it predict who wins? 
Could do both a classifier and a logistic regression to predict the score...?
make the label the team that won??????

Hm.
